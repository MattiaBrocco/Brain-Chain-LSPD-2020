# Brain-Chain-LSPD-2020

We welcome you to our repository “Brain Chain”.

With this repository, selecting a song title and its artist, you will be able to:
1) Get the lyrics of that song (API: lyrics.ovh);
2) Find out the link of the music sheet of that song of it is present (API: songsterr.com) ;
3) Search for songs similar to the one selected by us (API: SearchLy.com) ;
4) Search for other songs by the same artist (API: songsterr.com).
 
To reach our goal we will use some new public available APIs.

(However, before starting using the program, please follow the instructions.

The first thing to do is to download the repository and populate the database with your username and password.)


In this repository you can find a file named ```main.py``` that contains a _____________________small list of birthdays of famous people and a function ```return_birthday()``` that returns the birthday of a person. This function is used in the ```main.py``` file to test if "Albert Einstein" and "Alan Turing" are in the list. If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you the following result____________________________________________:

```
$ python main.py Oasis Wonderwall -v
```
